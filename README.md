# Predict My Number

This is a c++ based beginners project, in this user have to think of a number between the give range and now the program will show you some kind of sets 
now you as a user have to press yes or no (y/n) if your number is present in the set or not respectively.

After showing some sets answer will be shown on the screen.

This is a fun game to play.

I am learning Bits and Bytes and thought of this concept and successfully applied it.

You can try this on your system.
