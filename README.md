# Predict My Number

## Working

This is a Basic Project made by using C++. In this project the user will be asked to think of a number between the give range. The program will then show them some sets of numbers. The user will have to check if their selected number is present in the set and will have to respond by typing in *y* or *n* (yes or no).

After all sets are complete with user's responses, the number selected by the user will be displayed.

* This is a fun game to play.

* This game can be easily played on your local machine.
